VcfFiles

The VcfFiles repository contains my first Python scripts.  My goal for this project 
is to use it to learn Python. I chose to learn Python by getting a dataset and writing scripts 
that manipulate it into file formats that are easily visualized.  

I chose the Crohn's disease genomic dataset from the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI)
website.
