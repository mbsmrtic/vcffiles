VcfFiles

The VcfFiles repository contains my first Python scripts.  My goal for this project 
is to use it to learn Python. I chose to learn Python by getting a dataset and writing scripts 
that manipulate it into file formats that are easily visualized.  

I chose the Crohn's disease genomic dataset from the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI)
website.  

Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation website: https://genomeinterpretation.org/ 

Crohn's disease dataset: https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/crohns-disease-2012 

The format of the Crohn's disease dataset is Variant Call Format (vcf) files. A Variant Call Format file
is a standard format for storing genomic data. It only stores the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
that have alleles (A,C,G or T) that are different from a reference genome.
