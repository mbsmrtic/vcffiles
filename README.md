VcfFiles

The VcfFiles repository contains my first Python scripts.  My goal for this project 
is to use it to learn Python. I chose to learn Python by getting a dataset and writing scripts 
that manipulate it into file formats that are easily visualized.  

I chose the Crohn's disease genomic dataset from the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI)
website.  

Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation website: https://genomeinterpretation.org/ 

Crohn's disease dataset: https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/crohns-disease-2012 
If you want to run the python scripts on this dataset, register at the above link
and download the data into a folder called vcfdata under the existing vcffiles/data directory. 

The format of the Crohn's disease dataset is Variant Call Format (vcf) files. A Variant Call Format file
is a standard format for storing gene sequence variations. It only stores the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
that have alleles (A,C,G or T) that are different from a reference genome. 

The SNPs that have been identified as having alleles with significant association with Crohn's disease
are from Franke, A., & et.al. (2010, December). Genome-wide meta-analysis increases to 71 the number of 
confirmed Crohn's disease susceptibility loci. Nature Genetics, 42(12), 1118-25.
